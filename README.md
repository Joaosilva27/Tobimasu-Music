# Tobimasu

A simple music discovery app built with TypeScript and Tailwind. Despite API limitations (thanks to Deezer/Last.fm API rate restrictions), you can still:

- Search any artist

- Save favorite album covers

- Browse any discography

No music playback â€“ think of it as a digital album collector for your favorite artists.
